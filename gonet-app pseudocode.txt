waitgroup 
channels 
mutex 

reviews 

but this time i dont think we dont need channels

make functions for:
- calculating income

1. There are 4 pcs in Gonet
2. Customers buy billing from the operator
3. After that customers can pick any pc they want to use (use math/rand package to generate random number)
4. The pc that are being use can't be use or pick by other customers (use mutex to do this)
5. Use delays to add timer to the app
6. Update the Gonetz income (use mutex as well because we're upadating the same thing concurrently)

Wellcome to Gonet

- Agnes buy 1 hour billing 
- Agnes is now using pc 03
- Agnes billing is over 
- Agnes left pc 03
